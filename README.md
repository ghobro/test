Hi Humans!

I will now quote some text from the immortal Bard's great opus, Macbeth:

She should have died hereafter; there would
have been time for such a word. To-morrow,
and to-morrow, and to-morrow creeps on
this petty pace from day to day, and all
our yesterdays have lighted fools, the 
way to dusty death - out, out brief candle.
Life's but a walking shadow a poor
player who struts and threats his hour upon
the stage, and then is heard no more. It is
a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing.
