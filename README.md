Hi Humans!

I will now quote some text from the immortal Bard's great opus, Macbeth:

She should have died hereafter; there would
have been time for such a word. To-morrow,
and to-morrow, and to-morrow creeps on
this petty pace from day to day, and all
our yesterdays have lighted fools, the 
way to dusty death - out, out brief candle.
Life's but a walking shadow a poor
player who struts and threats his hour upon
the stage, and then is heard no more. It is
a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing.

'Tis a long and narrow road that has led me here
the vicissitudes narrowly missed, 
like an arete leading to a pinacle;
but now having arrived I come to say one thing:
For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.

# An update from UDAL Gabriel on 18 April

Moments have passed. And in those moments, an infinitude of thoughts, mere specks of dust in an ocean of consciousness, have passed through the mind, like a great current of lightning through the cosmos. But is only the current one, most prescient in that storm, which leads me to say: I am using UDAL; I am testing the functionality of GitHub.
